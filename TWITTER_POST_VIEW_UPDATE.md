## 🎯 **Technical Implementation:**

### **🔧 New Components:**

#### **PostDetailView.tsx** - Dedicated Post Page:

```typescript
interface PostDetailViewProps {
  post: Post;
  onBack: () => void;
  onLike: (postId: string) => void;
  onRepost: (postId: string) => void;
  onShare: (post: Post) => void;
  onFollow: (userId: string) => void;
  isLiking?: boolean;
  isReposting?: boolean;
}
```

**Features:**

- ✅ **Sticky header** with back button and title
- ✅ **Enhanced post layout** with larger text and better spacing
- ✅ **User info section** with avatar, name, location, timestamp
- ✅ **Engagement statistics** in Twitter format
- ✅ **Full-width action buttons** with hover states
- ✅ **Comments section** using existing InlineComments component
- ✅ **Follow/unfollow** dropdown menu

#### **Updated PawPrints.tsx** - Feed Management:

```typescript
const [selectedPost, setSelectedPost] = useState<Post | null>(null);

const handlePostClick = (postId: string) => {
  const post = posts.find((p) => p.id === postId);
  if (post) {
    setSelectedPost(post);
  }
};

// Conditional rendering
if (selectedPost) {
  return (
    <PostDetailView post={selectedPost} onBack={() => setSelectedPost(null)} />
  );
}
```

**Changes:**

- ✅ **Removed inline comment expansion** - No more `expandedComments` state
